3D Scanners and Cameras
   >Creating 3D models of real-world objects or environments is often a part of AR development. 3D scanners and cameras allow developers to capture physical objects or spaces and incorporate them into AR applications. Examples include structured light scanners, laser scanners, and photogrammetry cameras.

Development Kits and SDKs
   > AR development kits and software development kits (SDKs) are necessary for building AR applications. Platforms like Unity3D, Unreal Engine, ARKit (for iOS), ARCore (for Android), Vuforia, and Wikitude provide tools and resources for creating AR content.
